Dependency Analyzer is a Client-Server Application that uses the Code Analysis Engine (https://github.com/akhilpanchal/CodeAnalysisEngine). 
The Client connects to a server from a list of available servers and the selected Server sends a list of projects hosted on it that can be analyzed by the client.
This application demonstrates a prototype with 2 clients and 2 servers.
